From Nathan: 
"Ok, thinking about it, and looking more into my notes, I do think you should make the (Yee) lattice 
size around 1/10 of the rod diameter.  That will give you enough resolution for the features that matter.  
That's close to lambda / 50, so I would start there."

Problem 1:

Square lattice of cylindrical rods

lattice size a = 1.2um
radius = 0.2 * a
eps_r = 8.9

lambda = 1.55um

dx ~= lambda / 50

------

cell size = 50 
rod radius = 10
