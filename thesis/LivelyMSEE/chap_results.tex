Metrics were calculated using domain sizes ranging from 128x64 to 8192x4096 over 5000 frames. (In this case, a frame represents a complete time step wherein both E and H fields are updated.) For benchmarking purposes, the visualizer was disabled.

\end{figure}

As expected, As the number of computational cells in the simulation domain increases, the required computation time increases linearly.

	\label{fig:gridSizeVsComputeTime}
\end{figure}

Note that the total throughput (represented in the following figure as “cell” operations per second) increases dramatically as the domain size increases, until the point where GPU initialization overhead is outweighed by computation time.

Comparing to Meep:

\end{figure}

This gives us a speedup ranging from 1.2 to 8, depending on the domain size. At lower resolutions, the overhead of initializing assets on the GPU can outweigh the required simulation time, which accounts for the difference.
