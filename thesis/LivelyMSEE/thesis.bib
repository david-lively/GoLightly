In particular, we focus on aspects of implementing a full-featured FDTD package that go beyond standard textbook descriptions of the algorithm, or ways in which Meep differs from typical FDTD implementations. These include pervasive interpolation and accurate modeling of subpixel features, advanced signal processing, support for nonlinear materials via PadÃ© approximants, and flexible scripting capabilities.}

	abstract = {Medical imaging currently plays a crucial role throughout the entire clinical applications from medical scientific research to diagnostics and treatment planning. However, medical imaging procedures are often computationally demanding due to the large three-dimensional (3D) medical datasets to process in practical clinical applications. With the rapidly enhancing performances of graphics processors, improved programming support, and excellent price-to-performance ratio, the graphics processing unit (GPU) has emerged as a competitive parallel computing platform for computationally expensive and demanding tasks in a wide range of medical image applications. The major purpose of this survey is to provide a comprehensive reference source for the starters or researchers involved in GPU-based medical image processing. Within this survey, the continuous advancement of GPU computing is reviewed and the existing traditional applications in three areas of medical image processing, namely, segmentation, registration and visualization, are surveyed. The potential advantages and associated challenges of current GPU-based medical imaging are also discussed to inspire future applications in medicine.},

	abstract = "In this paper a novel approach to the optimization of large windfarms is presented. The wind turbine distribution at a given site is optimized in order to extract the maximum energy for the minimum installation costs. The optimization is made by associating a windfarm simulation model based on wake superposition with a genetic search code. The purpose of the paper is to prove the feasibility of the method by analyzing the results obtained in some simple applications. As a test case, a square site subdivided into 100 square cells as possible turbine locations has been taken, and the optimization is applied to the number and position of the turbines for three wind cases: single direction, constant intensity with variable direction, and variable intensity with variable direction."
