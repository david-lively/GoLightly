\chapter{GoLightly} \label{ch:golightly}

GoLightly is the GPU-based FDTD simulator application that is the focus and product of this thesis. Written using a combination of C++, CUDA and OpenGL, it provides a lightweight yet complete FDTD solution.

\section{Goals}

GoLightly is intended to address some issues that seem common to CPU-based solutions. In particular, it is designed to meet the following goals:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Be fast. An iterative design process requires rapid feedback from the simulator. 
	\item Be portable. Ideally, the simulator should run on a high-end consumer grade laptop.  
	\item Be friendly. Definition of models and other simulation parameters should not require expertise in software development or quasi-proprietary scripting languages.
\end{itemize}
