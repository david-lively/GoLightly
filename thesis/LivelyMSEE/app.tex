%\section{Description of GOY Shell Model Runs and Table}

%In most cases, we have forced the models in the first shell so that the inertial range %forms on the ultraviolet side.  However, in run 2 from Table \ref{table: app GOY table}, %we force in shell seven and observe an infra-red inertial range form.  Run 1 uses the %parameters of \cite{Yamada} originally used.  This run is used as a control and to %reproduce Pisarenko et. al. \cite{Pisarenko} work.  Run 2 is equivalent to Run 1 as far %as the parameters are concerned.  However, in this run, we force in shell 6.  As a %result, we see an infra-red inertial range.  We can apply the affine collapse to this %data as well. This result is of interest in the light of Carl Gibson idea that the true %cascade in turbulence is from small to large scales \cite{Gibson}. We start with small %forcing in Run 3.  Here, the forcing is small enough that the solution is quasi-periodic %and we have no inertial range.  We can observe this in the distribution of $u_n$.  In %this particular case, the points were located in a ring that was centered at the origin %(see Figure \ref{fig: circ symtrc}).   However, there is still circular symmetry about %the origin in this case.

\section{Meep scripts}

The shell script shown in listing \ref{meeptestsh} calls Meep in a loop, increasing the domain size from 128x64 cells (not including PML layers) to 8192x4096 cells in increments of 128x64 cells.

The Meep CTL code in listing \ref{benchmarkctl} defines a simulation with a dielectric block with $epsilon_{max}$ = 9. The simulation is run for 5000 frames. During testing, the simulation is timed and the results are written to a CSV file for later analysis.
